 Python Projects Collection

👋 Hello Sir/Madam,

This folder contains all my beginner Python projects. 
Each project is stored in its own folder with a "main.py" file (or similar) that can be run directly.

-----------------------------------
 HOW TO RUN ANY PROJECT
-----------------------------------
1. Open the project folder you want to test.
2. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.x recommended).
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder.
4. Run:
   python main.py

*Note:* Some projects may have extra files (images, text files, etc.). Keep them in the same folder as the main script.
